 *
 * What makes sharing safe is that the main thread only ever *replaces* an item's state, never
 * edits it under a reader: adding, deleting and reordering touch the live lists this snapshot
 * copied, and a [Stroke]'s samples are published whole through one volatile field. So the writer
 * always serializes a coherent item, though an edit landing mid-write may or may not be in the
 * file; that edit marks the document dirty again and the next autosave carries it.
 *
 * The flow is the exception: it is a tree of mutable lists with no such discipline, so it is still
 * deep-copied. It is small. Use [deepCopy] wherever the copy has to be independently editable.
