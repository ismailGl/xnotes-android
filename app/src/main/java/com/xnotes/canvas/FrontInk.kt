/**
 * Wet ink on the front buffer, for a paged note.
 *
 * The canvas here paints into the window with Skia, so the ink under the pen cannot be quicker than
 * the view tree's next frame. [GlWetPad] is a surface of its own, switched to `EGL_SINGLE_BUFFER`,
 * where a `glFlush` puts pixels on the glass without a queue or a refresh boundary in between. This
 * is the piece that decides what goes there, feeds it, and hands the stroke back at pen up.
 *
 * ### The view, as one scroll
 *
 * A page reaches the screen as `(p + pageRect.topLeft + insets) * zoom + origin`, which is a scroll
 * and a zoom and nothing else while the view is upright, so the pad needs no notion of pages at
 * all: the whole page transform bakes down into the scroll it is given at pen down. A *rotated*
 * view is the one case that does not fit, and it keeps the ordinary path.
 *
 * ### The handover
 *
 * At pen up the committed stroke is held out of the ink cache while the canvas as it stands is
 * captured and drawn *under* the ink already on the pad. The pad then holds an opaque copy of the
 * composite the screen was showing, the canvas underneath can take the stroke unseen, and taking
 * the pad down is a no-op on any refresh. Without it the two layers have to be raced, and one
 * refresh either way is a blink or a doubled antialiased edge.
 *
 * ### A hand that comes back down first
 *
 * The handover takes a capture and a canvas frame, which is tens of milliseconds, and handwriting
 * is quicker than that. A stroke that starts inside one *joins* the pad instead of taking it:
 * nothing is wiped, nothing is handed over, and the strokes accumulate until the hand pauses long
 * enough for one handover to cover all of them. Joining needs the new stroke to be painted through
 * exactly the view the pad was given, so a page crossing, a scroll or a zoom between the two ends
 * the run. There the pad is wiped as before, but only once the canvas has published what it was
 * showing; until then the new stroke rides the ordinary path, as it does at the start of any stroke.
